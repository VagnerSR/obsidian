### Range
Is the greatest value in the data set minus the smallest value.

### Interquartile Range (IQR)
It is the difference between the median of the second half of the data (Q3) and the median of the first half of the data (Q1). If the data set has an odd number of data points the median is excluded.
### Outliers
If the data set has an outlier the IQR will be a better representation of the spread than the standard deviation.

### Identifying Outliers Using the **1.5 × IQR Rule**

Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data set. One common method for identifying outliers is using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** and applying the **1.5 × IQR Rule**. Here's how you use the formulas:

Low outliers
$$Q_1 - 1.5(IQR)$$
Any data point lower than this value is considered a low outlier.

High outliers
$$Q_3 + 1.5(IQR)$$
Any data point higher than this value is considered a high outlier.
