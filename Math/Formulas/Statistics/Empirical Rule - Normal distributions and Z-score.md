### Empirical Rule
68 // 95 // 99.7
The **empirical rule**, also known as the **68-95-99.7 rule**, describes the percentage of values that fall within certain standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. The rule is as follows:

1. **68%** of the data falls within **1 standard deviation** of the mean:
    
    μ−σ to μ+σ
    
    This means that about 68% of the data lies between μ−σ and μ+σ.
    
2. **95%** of the data falls within **2 standard deviations** of the mean:
    
    μ−2σ to μ+2σ
    
    This means that about 95% of the data lies between μ−2σ and μ+2.
    
3. **99.7%** of the data falls within **3 standard deviations** of the mean:
    
    μ−3σ to μ+3σ
    
    This means that about 99.7% of the data lies between μ−3σ and μ+3.
    

This rule is used to quickly estimate the spread of data in a normal distribution and gives a good sense of how much data falls close to the mean.

### Z-score

$$Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$
**Z** is the z-score, which tells you how many standard deviations **σ** a value **x** is from the mean **μ**. Once you have the z-score, you can use it to find the corresponding percentile in a normal distribution.
