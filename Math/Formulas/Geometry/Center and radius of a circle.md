(h, k), r
$$(x-h)+(y-k)=r²$$

(0, 0), r
$$ x²+y²=r²$$

Example:
What are the center and radius of the circle (x+5)²+y²=11?

This equation is in the standard form for a circle, (x-h)+(y-k)=r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.

By comparing (x+5)²+y²=11 with (x-h)+(y-k)=r², we can identify the parameters as follows:

- The term (x+5)² can be written as (x−(−5))², which gives h=−5.
- The term y² can be written as (y−0)², which gives k=0.
- The right-hand side of the equation is 11, which represents r². Therefore, r=sqrt{11​}.

So, the center of the circle is (−5,0), and the radius is sqrt{11​}.
