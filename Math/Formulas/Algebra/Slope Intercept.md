p$$y=mx+b$$
- *y* represents the dependent variable (usually the vertical axis in a Cartesian coordinate system).
- *x* represents the independent variable (usually the horizontal axis).
- *m* is the slope of the line, which indicates how steep the line is.
- *b* is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

In simpler terms, *m* is the coefficient of *x*, and *b* is the constant term. The slope (*m*) tells you how much *y* changes for a one-unit change in *x*, and the y-intercept (*b*) tells you the point where the line intersects the y-axis when *x*=0.

For example, if you have the equation: $$y=2x+3$$

- The slope (*m*) is 2, indicating that for every one-unit increase in *x*, *y* increases by 2.
- The y-intercept (*b*) is 3, indicating that the line crosses the y-axis at the point (0, 3).

This form is particularly useful for graphing lines and understanding their behaviour.
