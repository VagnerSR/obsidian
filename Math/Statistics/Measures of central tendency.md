### Mean
Population
$$\mu=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N x_{i}}{N}$$
Sample
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_{i}}{n}$$
Weighted mean
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_{i}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i}$$

Grouped mean (m{i} is the mid point of each category)
$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i m_{i}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i}$$

Population is represented as N and the sample is represented as n.

### Median
Is the mid point of the data set, if the data set has an even number of data points, the median is the mean of the two numbers in the mid point.

### Mode
Is the data point that appears most in the data set. The data set can be no mode or bi-modal.


### Outliers
If the data set has an outlier the median will be a better representation of the central tendency.
