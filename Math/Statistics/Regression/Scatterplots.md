A **scatterplot** is a graph that shows the relationship between two quantitative variables. Each point on the plot represents a pair of data values, one for each variable. Scatterplots are useful for identifying patterns, trends, or relationships between variables.

### Regression Line Equation

When analyzing scatterplots, we often try to find a line that best represents the data points. This line is called the **regression line** (or line of best fit), and its equation is:

$$\hat{y}=mx+b$$
- **y\hat​** is the predicted value of the dependent variable (Y).
- **x** is the independent variable.
- **m** is the slope of the regression line (how much y changes for each unit change in x).
- **b** is the y-intercept (the value of y when x=0).

### How to Calculate the Slope (m)

The formula for the slope (mmm) of the regression line is:
$$m=\frac{n\sum xy-\sum x \sum y}{n \sum x² - (\sum x)²}$$
- n is the number of data points.
- ∑x y is the sum of the products of corresponding x and y values.
- ∑x is the sum of all x values.
- ∑y is the sum of all y values.
- ∑x² is the sum of the squares of the x values.

This formula tells us how steep the line is, indicating the strength of the relationship between xxx and y.

### How to Calculate the Intercept (b)

The formula for the intercept (b) of the regression line is:
$$b=\frac{\sum y-m \sum x}{n}$$
- This formula calculates where the regression line crosses the y-axis (i.e., when x=0).
- m is the slope calculated earlier.
- ∑y is the sum of all y values.
- ∑x is the sum of all x values.
- n is the number of data points.

### Interpretation:

- **Slope (m):** If the slope is positive, y increases as x increases, indicating a positive relationship. If the slope is negative, y decreases as x increases, showing a negative relationship.
- **Intercept (b):** This is the expected value of y when x=0. It helps anchor the regression line on the plot, though sometimes it may not have practical meaning depending on the data.

Scatterplots combined with the regression line help visualize the relationship between two variables and estimate how changes in the independent variable x affect the dependent variable y.
