Population
$$p_{xy}=\frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}$$
Sample
$$r_{xy}=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_x S_y}$$

S{xy} is the covariance, S{x} and S{y} are the standard deviation.
### Key Points About the Correlation Coefficient r:

- **Range**: The value of **r** always lies between **-1** and **1**.
    - r=1: Perfect **positive linear relationship** (as one variable increases, the other increases in a perfectly linear way).
    - r=−1: Perfect **negative linear relationship** (as one variable increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear way).
    - r=0: **No linear relationship** (the variables are uncorrelated; their movements are independent or non-linear).

### Interpretation of the Correlation Coefficient:

- **r=1**: This indicates a perfect positive linear relationship. As one variable increases, the other also increases by a consistent amount.
- **r=−1**: This indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. As one variable increases, the other decreases by a consistent amount.
- **0.7≤ r <1**: Strong positive linear relationship.
- **−1< r ≤−0.7**: Strong negative linear relationship.
- **0.3≤ r <0.7**: Moderate positive linear relationship.
- **−0.7< r ≤−0.3**: Moderate negative linear relationship.
- **−0.3< r <0.3**: Weak or no linear relationship.

### Example:

Let’s assume we have two variables, the number of hours studied (X) and the exam score (Y). The correlation coefficient tells us whether there's a linear relationship between studying more and scoring higher (or lower) on an exam.

If the correlation coefficient **r** is:

- **0.85**: This indicates a strong positive relationship—more studying generally leads to a higher score.
- **-0.90**: This indicates a strong negative relationship—perhaps, in a hypothetical scenario, more hours spent on irrelevant studying might decrease the score.
- **0.05**: This suggests that there’s very little relationship between studying and the score (at least in this data set).
