Population
$$\sigma_{xy}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\mu_x)(y_i-\mu_y)}{N}$$
Sample
$$S_{xy}=\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{X})(y_i-\bar{Y})}{n-1}$$

### Interpretation of the Covariance Value:

1. **Positive Covariance**:
    
    - If the covariance is **positive**, it indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.
    - This suggests a **positive relationship** between the two variables. For example, as height increases, weight may also increase.
2. **Negative Covariance**:
    
    - If the covariance is **negative**, it indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
    - This suggests a **negative relationship** between the two variables. For instance, as the number of hours spent watching TV increases, academic performance may decrease.
3. **Covariance Close to Zero**:
    
    - If the covariance is **close to zero**, it indicates that there is **no clear linear relationship** between the two variables. They are likely independent of each other or have a non-linear relationship.

### Key Points:

- Covariance only tells you the **direction** of the relationship (positive or negative), not how **strong** or **weak** the relationship is.
- A **large positive or negative value** does not necessarily imply a strong relationship. For that, you would need to look at the **correlation coefficient**, which normalizes the covariance to a value between **-1** and **1**.
