A **Bernoulli random variable** represents a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes: **success** (usually coded as 1) or **failure** (usually coded as 0). It is one of the simplest random variables used in probability theory and statistics.
### Success and Failure:

- **Success** is assigned a value of 1.
- **Failure** is assigned a value of 0.

Let X be a Bernoulli random variable, and let:
- p represent the probability of success (i.e., P(X=1)=p).
- 1−p represent the probability of failure (i.e., P(X=0)=1−p).
### Mean (Expected Value):
The **mean** (or expected value) of a Bernoulli random variable X is the long-run average outcome of the experiment. The formula for the expected value is:
$$E(X) = (failure\;\%)(0) + (succsess\;\%)(1)$$
Since failure contributes 0 to the expected value, and success contributes p, the mean simplifies to:
$$E(X) = p$$
This tells us that the expected value of a Bernoulli random variable is simply the probability of success.
### Variance and Standard Deviation:

The **variance** measures how much the values of the random variable vary around the mean. The formula for the variance of a Bernoulli random variable X is:

$$\sigma² = p(1-p)$$
